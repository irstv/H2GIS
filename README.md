H2GIS
=====

H2GIS is a spatial extension of the [H2](http://www.h2database.com/) database
engine in the spirit of [PostGIS](http://postgis.net/). It adds support for
managing spatial features and operations including a `Geometry` type, the [Open
Geospatial Consortium](http://www.opengeospatial.org/) (OGC) [Simple Features
for SQL](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sfs) (SFSQL) functions and
additional spatial functions that we (the [Atelier SIG](http://www.irstv.fr/))
develop. 

H2GIS is the main project for the new [OrbisGIS](http://www.orbisgis.org/) data
management library and is divided into 2 subprojects:
* H2Spatial

H2Spatial is a set of functions that permit to extend H2 with spatial storage and analysis capabilities. 
It includes  :

- a new data type called geometry that stored POINT, CURVE, SURFACE in a WKB representation,
- spatial operators as ST_Intersection, St_Difference...,
- spatial predicates as ST_Intersects, ST_Contains,
- R-Tree indexing and so on...

H2Spatial is licensed under the GPL 3 license terms.


* H2Drivers

H2Drivers is a collection of drivers to read and write new formats with H2. 
H2Drivers takes advantage of the TableEngine API to wrap in the H2 table model file format as shapefile, csv, ascii...
With the H2Drivers a user can execute SQL queries on another disk file format than H2.
H2Drivers is licensed under the GPL 3 license terms.

# How to Use

Follow [H2](http://www.h2database.com/) tutorial to download and install H2. Add h2spatial jar and [JTS](http://sourceforge.net/projects/jts-topo-suite/) 1.12 jar in the application Class Path.

[Create a DataBase](http://www.h2database.com/html/quickstart.html) and run the following commands to add spatial features:

```sql
CREATE ALIAS IF NOT EXISTS SPATIAL_INIT FOR "org.h2spatial.CreateSpatialExtension.initSpatialExtension";
CALL SPATIAL_INIT();
```
