H2GIS
=====

H2GIS is a spatial extension of the [H2](http://www.h2database.com/) database
engine in the spirit of [PostGIS](http://postgis.net/). It adds support for
managing spatial features and operations including a `Geometry` type, the [Open
Geospatial Consortium](http://www.opengeospatial.org/) (OGC) [Simple Features
for SQL](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sfs) (SFSQL) functions and
additional spatial functions that we (the [Atelier SIG](http://www.irstv.fr/))
develop. 

H2GIS is the main project for the new [OrbisGIS](http://www.orbisgis.org/) data
management library and is divided into 2 subprojects:
* H2Spatial
* H2Drivers
